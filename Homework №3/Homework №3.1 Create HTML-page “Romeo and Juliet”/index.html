                    <div class="dline">Two households, both alike in dignity,
                    <div class="dline">In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
                    <div class="dline">From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
                    <div class="dline">Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
                    <div class="dline">From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
                    <div class="dline">A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
                    <div class="dline">Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
                    <div class="dline">Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
                    <div class="dline">The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
                    <div class="dline">And the continuance of their parents' rage,
                    <div class="dline">Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
                    <div class="dline">Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
                    <div class="dline">The which if you with patient ears attend,
                    <div class="dline">What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
